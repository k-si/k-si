### Hi, my friend

I'm ksir, a coder from China. Graduated from Hebei Normal University in 2022. I'm very interested in the low level of linux kernel, db, network service framework. In life, I like all kinds of new activities, such as archery, ice hockey, tennis, volleyball, etc.

I used to like playing basketball very much, but due to the epidemic and lack of self-discipline, I have gained a lot of weight now, and I can no longer play :(

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ByteDance, focusing on the recording and playback of network traffic
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ebpf, automaton and rust
